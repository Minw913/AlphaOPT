If the labor force itself is not fully utilized, they can work externally, earning 2.1 yuan/person-day in spring and summer and 1.8 yuan/person-day in autumn and winter.\n\nThe farm cultivates three types of crops: soybeans, corn, and wheat, and also raises dairy cows and chickens. Crop cultivation requires no specialized investment, but raising animals involves an investment of 400 yuan per dairy cow and 3 yuan per chicken. Raising dairy cows requires allocating 1.5 hectares of land per cow to grow feed, and involves 100 person-days in autumn and winter, and 50 person-days in spring and summer per cow. The annual net income is 400 yuan per dairy cow. Raising chickens does not use land, requires 0.6 person-days in autumn and winter, and 0.3 person-days in spring and summer per chicken. Annual net income is 2 yuan per chicken. The current chicken coop can accommodate up to 3,000 chickens, and the cow barn can accommodate up to 32 dairy cows.

    "description": "A factory produces two types of food, I and II, and currently has 50 skilled workers. It is known that one skilled worker can produce $10 \\ \\mathrm{kg} / \\ \\mathrm{h}$ of food I or $6 \\ \\mathrm{kg} / \\ \\mathrm{h}$ of food II. According to contract bookings, the weekly demand for these two foods will rise sharply, as shown in Table 1-11. Therefore, the factory has decided to train 50 new workers by the end of the 8th week. It is known that a worker works $40 \\ \\mathrm{h}$ per week, and a skilled worker can train up to three new workers in two weeks (during the training period, both the skilled worker and the trainees do not participate in production). The weekly wage of a skilled worker is 360 yuan, the weekly wage of a trainee during the training period is 120 yuan, and after training, the wage is 240 yuan per week, with the same production efficiency as skilled workers. During the transition period of training, many skilled workers are willing to work overtime, and the factory has decided to arrange some workers to work $60 \\ \\mathrm{h}$ per week, with a weekly wage of 540 yuan. If the booked food cannot be delivered on time, the compensation fee for each week of delay per $ \\ \\mathrm{kg}$ is 0.5 yuan for food I and 0.6 yuan for food II. Under these conditions, how should the factory make comprehensive arrangements to minimize the total cost?\n\nTable 1-11\n\n| Week | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |\n|------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| I    | 10000 | 10000  | 12000  | 12000  | 16000  | 16000  | 20000  | 20000  |\n| II   | 6000 | 7200 | 8400 | 10800 | 10800 | 12000  | 12000  | 12000  |",

Product II requires 15,000 units per month from March to September and 50,000 units per month during other months. The cost of producing these two products at a certain factory is as follows: Product I costs 5 yuan per unit to produce from January to May, and 4.50 yuan per unit from June to December; Product II costs 8 yuan per unit to produce from January to May, and 7 yuan per unit from June to December. The factory's combined production capacity for both products should not exceed 120,000 units per month. Product I has a volume of 0.2 cubic meters per unit, Product II has a volume of 0.4 cubic meters per unit, and the factory's warehouse capacity is 15,000 cubic meters. If the factory's warehouse space is insufficient, external warehouse space can be rented. Using the factory’s own warehouse costs 1 yuan per cubic meter per month, while renting an external warehouse increases this cost to 1.5 yuan per cubic meter per month. Given that the initial inventory of both products at the beginning of July is zero, how should production be scheduled from July to December to minimize the total production and inventory costs while meeting market demand?",

The planning department, based on the actual situation of the factory, has provided the production capacity and production cost for the next 4 weeks, as shown in Table 1. When there is a surplus of beverages after meeting the demand each week, a storage cost of 0.2 thousand yuan per week per thousand boxes of beverages needs to be paid. How should the production plan be arranged to minimize the total cost (the sum of production cost and storage cost) over the four weeks while meeting the weekly market demand?\n\nTable 1 Beverage Production and Demand Data:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}\n\\hline \nWeek & Demand/1000 boxes & Production Capacity/1000 boxes & Cost per 1000 boxes/1000 yuan \\\\\n\\hline \n1 & 15 & 30 & 5.0 \\\\\n\\hline \n2 & 25 & 40 & 5.1 \\\\\n\\hline \n3 & 35 & 45 & 5.4 \\\\\n\\hline \n4 & 25 & 20 & 5.5 \\\\\n\\hline \nTotal & 100 & 135 & \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}",

The first method takes $a=2$ hours per furnace and costs $m=50$ in fuel expenses; the second method takes $b=3$ hours per furnace and costs $n=70$ in fuel expenses. Assuming each furnace produces $k=10$ tons of steel regardless of the method used, and that at least $d=30$ tons of steel must be produced within $c=12$ hours, how should these two methods be allocated to minimize fuel expenses?
