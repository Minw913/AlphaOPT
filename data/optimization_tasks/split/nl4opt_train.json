A container of Oil Max contains 46 grams of substance A, 43 grams of substance B and 56 grams of substance C. A container of Oil Max Pro contains 13 grams of substance A, 4 grams of substance B and 45 grams of substance C. The car manufacturer has 1345 grams of substance A, 346 grams of substance B, 1643 grams of substance C. In addition, the profit per container of Oil Max is $10 and the profit per container of Oil Max Pro is $15. How many containers of each of oil should the car manufacturer make to maximize profit?",

The specialized company can annotate at a rate of 60 images per hour whereas the common company can annotate at a rate of 40 images per hour. However, the specialized company charges $100 per hour and the common company charges $72 per hour. The researcher has deadlines to meet and must complete a dataset of at least 10,000 images. They also have some special images that only the specialized company can annotate. Therefore, at least a third of work must be allocated to the specialized company. How should the researcher distribute the annotations to the two companies to minimize the cost of annotating the whole dataset?",
