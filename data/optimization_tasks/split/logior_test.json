The forklift requirements for the warehouse over the next 7 weeks are 6, 9, 12, 8, 5, 7 and 4. The logistics company plans to lease forklifts from a rental company, which offers the following leasing options:\n\n1. Long-term forklift rental: The lease term is fixed at 7 weeks, with a rental cost of 240 yuan per week. Forklifts under long-term lease are available for the entire lease period.\n2. Short-term forklift rental: The lease term is flexible, available on a weekly basis, with a rental cost of 390 yuan per week. Short-term leased forklifts are only available during the week they are leased.\n3. Shared forklifts: These are vehicles jointly leased with other warehouses, but they are only available in weeks 2, 4, and 5. The rental cost is 220 yuan per week.\n4. Promotional forklifts: These forklifts can be leased at a discounted rate during the last 4 weeks, with a rental cost of 190 yuan per week. A maximum of 2 promotional forklifts can be leased per week.\n\nPlease design a leasing plan that fully meets the warehouse's forklift requirements over the next 7 weeks while minimizing the total leasing cost.",

The center has 4 inbound docks (I1, I2, I3, I4) and 3 outbound docks (O1, O2, O3), distributed across two different operational zones. The docks in Zone A include I1, I2, and O1, while Zone B includes I3, I4, O2, and O3. The efficiency of forklift operations within a zone decreases with congestion, which is modeled as a cost function that is quadratic in the total number of items passing through that zone. The congestion cost coefficient is 0.00005 for Zone A and 0.00004 for Zone B. Decision-makers need to assign a unique dock to each shipment to minimize the total internal handling cost, which is composed of a base handling cost and a zonal congestion cost. The base handling cost is ¥0.1 per item. The arriving shipments consist of four suppliers: S1 with 200 items, S2 with 150 items, S3 with 180 items, and S4 with 220 items.

New environmental regulations require that the average carbon emissions of all vehicles deployed over the next three years cannot exceed 40 grams per kilometer annually. Each Type X vehicle generates $25,000 in revenue, costs $18,000 to operate, and emits 70 grams of carbon per kilometer. Each Type Y vehicle generates $20,000 in revenue, costs $16,000 to operate, and emits 30 grams of carbon per kilometer. Due to fleet capacity constraints, CargoLink can deploy a maximum of 400 vehicles each year. The maximum number of each vehicle type that can be deployed annually is shown in the table below.

The company needs to optimize its weekly delivery operations to minimize total transportation costs while satisfying regulatory constraints and customer demands.\n\nThe three distribution centers have different storage capacities and operational costs. Center A can handle up to 800 units per week with a fixed operating cost of $2,500, Center B can handle up to 600 units per week with a fixed cost of $2,000, and Center C can handle up to 500 units per week with a fixed cost of $1,800. Each retail outlet has specific weekly demand requirements ranging from 45 to 120 units, and due to regulatory compliance, each outlet must receive deliveries from exactly one distribution center to maintain proper tracking and accountability.\n\nThe transportation cost varies based on the distance between distribution centers and retail outlets, ranging from $8 to $25 per unit delivered. Additionally, there are regulatory constraints that limit the maximum number of outlets each distribution center can serve - Center A can serve at most 7 outlets, Center B can serve at most 6 outlets, and Center C can serve at most 5 outlets. The company must also ensure that the total demand assigned to each center does not exceed its capacity, and all retail outlets must be served to maintain market coverage.\n\n| Outlet | Demand | Cost from A | Cost from B | Cost from C |\n|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| 1      | 85     | $12         | $18         | $22         |\n| 2      | 67     | $15         | $11         | $25         |\n| 3      | 92     | $20         | $14         | $16         |\n| 4      | 78     | $13         | $19         | $23         |\n| 5      | 105    | $17         | $12         | $20         |\n| 6      | 56     | $25         | $16         | $14         |\n| 7      | 120    | $14         | $21         | $18         |\n| 8      | 73     | $16         | $13         | $24         |\n| 9      | 89     | $19         | $15         | $17         |\n| 10     | 95     | $11         | $22         | $19         |\n| 11     | 62     | $23         | $17         | $15         |\n| 12     | 84     | $18         | $14         | $21         |\n| 13     | 76     | $21         | $20         | $13         |\n| 14     | 45     | $24         | $25         | $16         |\n| 15     | 58     | $22         | $23         | $12         |",

Organic cotton fabric can be manufactured by processing either organic cotton or jute. Linen fabric can be produced from any of the raw materials—organic cotton, jute, or linen. Jute fabric, on the other hand, can be created by processing jute or linen. The production process for organic cotton fabric reduces the input fiber by 30%, leaving 70% for the final product.

Due to interdependencies where some ships carry import/export goods required by other ships, there are collaborative operation requirements between them. Specifically, ship C can only start loading after ship A completes unloading; ship E can only start loading after ship D completes unloading. To incentivize efficient collaboration, a **¥50,000 \"rapid transshipment\" bonus** can be earned if the start time of a dependent task (e.g., C starting to load) immediately follows the completion time of its predecessor task (e.g., A completing unloading) with a time gap of 2 hours or less.

The Portland brewery can produce up to 200,000 gallons of craft beer annually, while the Asheville brewery can produce up to 300,000 gallons. Once brewed, the beer is shipped to two distribution hubs: Seattle and Atlanta. Each distribution hub can handle up to 400,000 gallons per year. Due to differences in shipping and production costs, the profit (in dollars) per thousand gallons shipped depends on the brewery and the destination hub (see Table 1). CraftBrew Inc. is considering expanding the capacity of each brewery.

    "description": "A courier company needs to plan an optimal single-delivery route for one of its couriers. The route starts at a central depot, serves 10 customers, and then returns to the depot. The courier's travel speed is constant at 30 km/h, and the travel cost is ¥5 per kilometer.\nEach customer has a desired \"service time window.\" If the courier's actual arrival time deviates from the center of the customer's desired time window, the company incurs a \"customer satisfaction penalty\" cost. This cost is proportional to the square of the time deviation, calculated by the formula: $Cost = 0.2 \\times (\\text{Actual Arrival Time} - \\text{Time Window Center})^2$.\nThe company's objective is to determine a unique customer visit sequence and calculate a precise arrival time for each customer to minimize the cost. The courier departs at 8:30 AM from the depot, located at coordinates (0,0).

The objective function includes a quadratic penalty for time window deviations, but the solver program linearizes this by using a quadratic term directly in Gurobi's objective, which is handled by its QP solver. However, the core decision variables for routing (x_ij) are binary, and the time flow and subtour elimination constraints are linear, making it a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) if the quadratic term is handled as a special case by the solver or if it's a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP). Given the use of `GRB.BINARY` and `GRB.CONTINUOUS` variables with linear constraints and a quadratic objective, it's a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP), which is a specific type of MILP. The application is clearly in the transportation sector, specifically courier services."
