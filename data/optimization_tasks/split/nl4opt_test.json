A retail store brings in 200 customers every day and requires 6 employees to operate. A factory outlet brings in 80 customers every day and due to the lower traffic and being in more remote areas, requires 4 employees to run. Company executives decided that there must be at least 1200 customers every day, and can make available 50 employees. How should the company distribute their product to the two types of store to reduce the number of stores that must be open?",
